# Quick start

A simple way to get introduced to PIP.WebUI is to go trough this tutorial which give basic knowledge of
using this library. The application you will build is a color picker component to switch title color.

## Environment setup

The further part of the tutorial is explained how to set up an environment on your local machine for
development.

### Git

If you want to develop not simple apps your have to use concurrent version system (CVS). The most]
widespread and handy CVS is Git. If you aren't familiar with this one, please, pass the
[tutorial](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/2) about this CVS.

For installing you can download it and install following the instruction [download](https://git-scm.com/download).
Once installed, you should get the `git` command in your terminal.

### Node.js and npm

NPM (Node Package Manager) is needed for downloading any vendors libraries (exactly PIP.WebUI library).
NPM is installed with Node.js together.

The install package for Node.js you can download through [link](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
After installation you get `node` and `npm` commands in your terminal.

## Clone initial project

It is not any necessity to write everything. Thus we create an initial project state to make easier
start development. Also it lets you to focus on more essential things instead of meaningless copy-past.

To clone project seed execute below commands. After cloning you should install dependencies
needed to development.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AndriiPidhirnyi/pip-webui-tutorial-seed.git &&
cd pip-webui-tutorial-seed &&
npm install
```
